    about: "If you've never taken care of a plant before and want an easy start, the snake plant is the one for you. You'd have to try pretty hard to actually kill one. It thrives on neglect, responding best to the lightest of watering and then just being left alone. It will appreciate a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer, but that's about as much special attention as it needs.",

    about: "The large oval leaves of the Audrey fig, with their pale green veins, make for a very handsome houseplant. Its tall, dense growth makes it a good choice for anywhere you want a bit of impact. 

In the wild, this tree can become absolutely enormous, reaching a height of around 30 metres and as much as 200 metres in diameter. It grows all across India – in fact, it's the national tree of India – and it's valued for the shade its giant canopy provides in the extreme heat.

It's sometimes rather gruesomely known as strangling fig because in the wild it begins its life growing in the branches of large trees. Gradually, it wraps itself around its host, until eventually it envelops it completely. Don't worry, it won't try to strangle any of your other plants.",

  about: "Monstera adansonii is often confused with monstera obliqua. In fact, you'll quite often see adanosonii advertised as obliqua. They're not quite the same and if you see a monstera obliqua selling at a reasonable price, it's all but certain it's really an adansonii.

Monstera obliqua is incredibly rare, even in the wild, and would cost thousands to acquire. Its leaves are paper thin and skeletal, with more hole than leaf. Adansonii has slightly thicker, sturdier leaves. But don't think of it as inferior to obliqua. It gives you all the pleasure of a monstera obliqua without the price tag or the need to find a shady black market dealer.

Monstera adansonii is a relative of the larger Swiss Cheese plant, or Chaz. It has the same irregular leaves. In the jungles of Central and South America, it lives in the shade of other trees. All those holes let light shine through to its lower leaves. As a house plant, all those holes just make it look really cool.

It's very easy to look after. Give it a medium level of light and moderate watering. In spring and summer, it will appreciate a monthly feed with liquid fertiliser.",

  commonName: "devil's ivy",
  about: "Devil's ivy, golden pothos, ceylon creeper, hunter's robe, or as we call it, Rapunzel. It has so many names because it's one of the most popular houseplants in the world. There are two reasons for that. 1) It's extremely versatile. It's a fantastic hanging plant, looks great on a shelf or mantelpiece, or can even be trained up a wall. 2) It's incredibly easy to care for. We recommend our 16cm clay pots as the best fit
      In the wild, devil's ivy is usually found in forests in south-east Asia. It grows up the trunks of large trees, happily living in quite deep shade. That's how it gets its name, devil's ivy, because it's a friend of the darkness
  As an indoor plant, its needs are simple. It manages in almost any light conditions, needs infrequent watering and generally just gets on with things. It will appreciate a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer
  This is an ideal beginner's plant that gives impressive results with very little work from you
  Did you know?
  In the wild, they can reach up to 20-metres tall, so there's a growing challenge for you",

  commonName: "Fig Tree",
  about: "Once you've picked and eaten a fig straight off the tree, warm from the sun, you'll wonder why you haven't been growing them for years. Not only is the fruit delicious, the leaves have a soft fragrance that hangs in the air all through summer. 

  Native to the Mediterranean, figs have become very popular in the UK. Our climate may not have Mediterranean warmth but varieties like this one, 'Perretta', can deal with cold weather and will produce plenty of fruit. We advise keeping this tree in a pot, which will restrict its growth to about a maximum of 2 metres. If you plant it in the ground be prepared for it to grow up to 4 metres.
  
  Fig trees are an investment. You're unlikely to get fruit the first year, but take care of them and they'll reward you with fruit ever after.
  
  For the happiest possible tree, put yours somewhere sunny and sheltered from harsh winds. Water regularly so the soil stays moist and feed weekly in spring and summer. Unlike most fruit trees, the fig doesn't grow flowers before it fruits. The fruit grows straight from the branch and the flowers are actually inside the fruit. That's why they're so strikingly pink inside. Fruit should be ready to harvest by late summer/early autumn. It's ready when it feels soft and comes off the branch easily.
  
  Keep your tree healthy by pruning it once per year, in late winter. Just snip off any weak or broken growth and give it a tidy up until it's the shape you want. Don't leave it too late to prune. Pruning in spring can cause your tree to lose a lot of sap, which would weaken it. You wouldn't want to stop it making all that lovely fruit.

  commonName: "peace lily",
  about: "As you may have guessed from its love of steamy conditions, the peace lily is native to tropical rainforests, specifically those of South and Central America. It's thought it was brought to Europe some time in the late 1800s and it's adapted well to the UK's less than tropical conditions.
     As exotic as it looks, its light and water needs are modest. It will cope in quite low light, though prefers indirect light, and as long as its humidity needs are met it's generally happy and should flower throughout spring. It will appreciate a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer. As well as being an elegant beauty, this plant is a hardworking air-purifyer.",

  commonName: "Bay Tree",
  about: "The bay tree, or bay laurel, has been a beloved plant for centuries. The ancient Greeks and the ancient Romans considered it quite the status symbol. Wreaths of bay laurel were worn on the heads of the most important members of society and given as prizes in sporting competitions. Bay was a plant for champions. 

  You don't see a lot of people wearing it on their heads these days, but the bay tree is as popular as ever. It's an evergreen, which means it will look good on your patio or balcony all year round, and it's very easy to look after. It will love a sunny spot, though will be happy with a mix of sun and shade.
  
  It likes gentle watering, so just give it a drink when the top two inches of soil feel dry. Don't be tempted to water it too heavily as it won't like soggy soil. Equally, don't let it dry out completely. Your plant will arrive in a nursery pot (the plastic pot it's been growing in). There's no need to remove it from this. Just place the whole thing inside a decorative pot.
  
  One of the best things about bay is that you can pick off its leaves and use them in cooking. A bay leaf added to pasta sauce or stew will add subtle warm flavour. A leaf picked fresh off your plant will have much more flavour than any from the supermarket.",

  commonName: "English Ivy",
  about: "English ivy (Hedera helix) is an easy-to-grow plant that does not like direct sunlight but does prefer bright light. It needs moist soil and cooler temperatures than most other house plants at about 50°F to 65°F (10°C to 18°C). Ivy likes humidity, so make sure you mist it or place it in a tray of pebbles and water. Regular fertilizing, except during the winter, is important to English ivy.",

  commonName: "cactus",
  about: "There is an enormous variety of cacti around the world, most of them cheerfully living in hot, dry conditions where most other plants would perish. They're succulents, which means they can store large amounts of water to keep them alive through long droughts.

  They rarely have leaves, because leaves mean moisture loss. Instead many have developed hard spikes, which both minimise evaporation and keep pesky animals away. 
  
  A small cactus is a great starter plant or gift because it's so easy to care for. It will tolerate lower light conditions, but thrives in sun, and needs very little water. Cacti would much much rather be too dry than too wet. Try to make yours think it's in the desert.
  
  Please note that your cactus will arrive in a nursery pot. We have lots of plant pots available to make them look even smarter. ",

  commonName: "chinese money plant",
  about: "Native to the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces of southern China, the Chinese money plant was first brought to the UK in 1906 by Scottish botanist George Forrest (yes, we know the exact man who found it). It became a popular houseplant later in the 20th century because it is simple to grow and really easy to propagate, meaning friends could pass cuttings around amongst themselves. That earned it the nickname 'pass it on plant'.

  Those round, flat leaves, which can grow as big as 15cm across, have earned it other nicknames, from UFO plant to pancake plant. Whatever you choose to call it, it's an excellent house guest. A bright place to live and water when it's dry are all it asks (by the way, don't worry when it loses its lower leaves as it grows - it's totally normal). It will also thank you for a monthly feed with liquid fertiliser in spring and summer (dilute the feed to half strength as it doesn't like its drinks strong).This one's a winner. Pass it on.
  
  Your plant will arrive in a brown nursery pot, which has holes for drainage. Decorative pots are sold separately. There's no need to remove the plant from the nursery pot. Just pop the whole thing in a decorative pot.

  commonName: "french lavender",
  about: "If your aesthetic leans more towards Provencal countryside than English garden, Laurens is the guy for you. Like his English cousin, Vanda, he's got fragrant purple blooms, but Laurens' flowers grow upwards from the top of his stalks, in little bursts resembling rabbit's ears. His blood runs warmer than Vanda's too, and he can't get enough sun. He'll be at his most beautiful and flowery during summer months.

  It's not just his looks that are magical either; Laurens' powers range from being a natural antiseptic to anti-inflammatory, and he works great in aromatherapy to help you relax. He can also curb nausea and headaches and works as an insect repellant - basically, there's not much he can't do. Laurens is amongst the most fragrant varieties of lavender, so cut off his blooms and use them to make your own essential oils, or make sachets of dried buds to keep under your pillow. We think you'll sleep a little easier knowing Laurens is around.",

  commonName: "curly spider plant",
  about: "A classic of the houseplant world, the curly spider plant has been grown indoors for decades because it's incredibly easy to take care of. In the wild, it's most commonly found in tropical parts of Africa and Australia. 

  A wild version might grow as tall as 60cm, with, bizarrely, flower stems that can be up to 75cm long. Indoors, it's a compact plant that will live cheerfully in living rooms, bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchens - anywhere. It's equally happy hanging as in a pot.
  
  Water it lightly and give it bright, indirect light for best results (it will be fine in lower light too, but growth will be weaker). You can also give it a growth boost by feeding it with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer.
  
  This is one spider nobody need be afraid of."
