    about: "If you've never taken care of a plant before and want an easy start, the snake plant is the one for you. You'd have to try pretty hard to actually kill one. It thrives on neglect, responding best to the lightest of watering and then just being left alone. It will appreciate a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer, but that's about as much special attention as it needs.",

All it asks is a fairly bright spot in your home and an occasional drink. The money tree is known by many lovely names: French peanut, Guiana nut, Malabar chestnut, provision tree, monguba, pumpo. Or to botanists, pachira aquatica. It's usually found growing in swamps in Central and South America. It's plaited trunk doesn't occur naturally, but it's become traditional to plait it when grown as a houseplant. For reasons that aren't entirely clear, this plant is believed to bring good fortune and prosperity. In Asia, it's become very popular as an office plant, as it's thought it will help a business thrive. Got to be worth a try, right? \n This plant does well in both home or office. It just likes to live somewhere light, though out of direct sun, and to be watered when the top two inches of soil feel dry. It also likes to be misted occasionally. Look after it and in return it might make you rich, hopefully.",
